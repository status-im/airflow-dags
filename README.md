# Description

This repo contains implementations of Airflow workflows and tasks called respectively [DAGs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#dags) and [Operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#operators).

* DAGs - Direct Acyclic Graphs - Python scripts defining workflows in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies.
* Operators - Functions within these python scripts which define the individual tasks that are executed as part of a DAG run.

To learn how to write DAGs and Operators read about [core concepts](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#concepts) and follow the [official tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial.html).
